As a result, the crowd and media angrily condemn Chick's victory but praise Lightning's sportsmanship. Lightning is offered the Dinoco sponsorship, but he declines and stays with Rust-eze out of loyalty for their past support.

When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis.\"\n","       <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-adisney1_11-1\">\n","        <a href=\"#cite_note-adisney1-11\">\n","         [11]\n","        </a>\n","       </sup>\n","      </p>\n","      <p>\n","       Years later in 2013, Klubien said the film was both his best and most bitter experience because he was fired before it premiered and because he feels Lasseter wrote him out of the story of how the film got made.\n","       <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-16\">\n","        <a href=\"#cite_note-16\">\n","         [16]\n","        </a>\n","       </sup>\n","      </p>\n","      <h3>\n","       <span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Animation\">\n","        Animation\n","       </span>\n","      </h3>\n","      <div class=\"thumb tright\">\n","       <div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:176px;\">\n","        <a class=\"image\" href=\"/wiki/File:Carsanimation.png\">\n","         <img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-file-height=\"175\" data-file-width=\"174\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"175\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/31/Carsanimation.png\" width=\"174\"/>\n","        </a>\n","        <div class=\"thumbcaption\">\n","         <div class=\"magnify\">\n","          <a class=\"internal\" href=\"/wiki/File:Carsanimation.png\" title=\"Enlarge\">\n","          </a>\n","         </div>\n","         A rendered frame from the development of the film.\n","        </div>\n","       </div>\n","      </div>\n","      <p>\n","       For the cars themselves, Lasseter also visited the design studios of the Big Three Detroit automakers, particularly J Mays of Ford Motor Company.\n","       <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-adisney1_11-2\">\n","        <a href=\"#cite_note-adisney1-11\">\n","         [11]\n","        </a>\n","       </sup>\n","       Lasseter learned how real cars were designed.\n","       <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-adisney1_11-3\">\n","        <a href=\"#cite_note-adisney1-11\">\n","         [11]\n","        </a>\n","       </sup>\n","      </p>\n","      <p>\n","       In 2006, Lasseter spoke about how they worked hard to make the animation believable, saying: \"It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator to be able to put some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way.\"\n","       <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-adisney1_11-4\">\n","        <a href=\"#cite_note-adisney1-11\">\n","         [11]\n","        </a>\n","       </sup>\n","      </p>\n","      <p>\n","       Unlike most anthropomorphic cars, the eyes of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the\n","       <a href=\"/wiki/Tonka\" title=\"Tonka\">\n","        Tonka\n","       </a>\n","       Talking Trucks, the characters from\n","       <a href=\"/wiki/Tex_Avery\" title=\"Tex Avery\">\n","        Tex Avery\n","       </a>\n","       's\n","       <i>\n","        <a href=\"/wiki/One_Cab%27s_Family\" title=\"One Cab's Family\">\n","         One Cab's Family\n","        </a>\n","       </i>\n","       short and Disney's own\n","       <i>\n","        <a href=\"/wiki/Susie_the_Little_Blue_Coupe\" title=\"Susie the Little Blue Coupe\">\n","         Susie the Little Blue Coupe\n","        </a>\n","       </i>\n","       ), rather than within the headlights.\n","       <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-adisney1_11-5\">\n","        <a href=\"#cite_note-adisney1-11\">\n","         [11]\n","        </a>\n","       </sup>\n","       According to\n","       <a href=\"/wiki/Production_designer\" title=\"Production designer\">\n","        production designer\n","       </a>\n","       Bob Pauley, \"From the very beginning of this project,\n","       <a href=\"/wiki/John_Lasseter\" title=\"John Lasseter\">\n","        John Lasseter\n","       </a>\n","       had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights.

With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character.\n","       <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-adisney1_11-6\">\n","        <a href=\"#cite_note-adisney1-11\">\n","         [11]\n","        </a>\n","       </sup>\n","       This decision was heavily criticized by automotive blog\n","       <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Jalopnik\" title=\"Jalopnik\">\n","        Jalopnik\n","       </a>\n","       .\n","       <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\">\n","        <a href=\"#cite_note-17\">\n","         [17]\n","        </a>\n","       </sup>\n","      </p>\n","      <p>\n","       In 2006, the supervising animator of the film, Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: \"Getting a full range of performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction.

We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality that might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone.\"\n","       <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-adisney1_11-12\">\n","        <a href=\"#cite_note-adisney1-11\">\n","         [11]\n","        </a>\n","       </sup>\n","       Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: \"Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we've seen in any of our previous films.

Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall.\"\n","       <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-adisney1_11-14\">\n","        <a href=\"#cite_note-adisney1-11\">\n","         [11]\n","        </a>\n","       </sup>\n","       Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: \"The ground-locking system is one of the things I'm most proud of on this film.

We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It's subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you'll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it.
